        <h2>Abstract </h2>
        <p> In this Scholarly HTML document, we focus on specifying the
            design and implementation of a mobile and smartwatch platform for a
            mental health application.

      <h2><span></span>Introduction </h2>
      <h3><span></span> Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        Mental Health Companion App (Mehe) is a smart companion assistant that keeps track of the user's mental health. From checking the level of daily exercises/movement, lieaks, and
        meditation to interacting with other positive-energy people. The application can also track levels of burnout at work
        and offer intervention-like experiences to help motivate users. The application is distributed on various devices so
        that the user stays engaged. Gamification elements are also an added touch.
      </p>
      <h3><span></span> Motivation </h3>
      <p>
          We selected this project for the Human-Computer Interaction course because of our desire to develop a product that can
          positively impact people's daily lives. Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, and we believe that by
          focusing on this area, we can make a meaningful difference. We also strongly believe that the user experience is a key
          factor in the success of any product, and especially in the case of mental health applications, where the user's state of mind is a crucial aspect.

        Scholarly HTML is a domain-specific rich document format built entirely on open standards
        that enables the interoperable exchange of scholarly articles in a manner that is compatible
        with off-the-shelf liowsers. This document describes how Scholarly HTML works and how it is
        encoded.

      <h2><span></span>Research Tactics</h2>
      <p>
          During any project, research is a crucial step in understanding the problem space and the user's needs. In our
          case, we focused on the following research tactics:
      <ul>
          <li>Competitive analysis</li>
          <li>Surveys</li>
      </ul>
      We chose these tactics because they provide a comprehensive view of the problem space and the user's needs
      and expectations. The competitive analysis helps us understand what other products are available on the
      market and how they address similar problems. The surveys help us gather direct feedback from potential users
      and understand their needs and expectations.
      </p>
      <h2><span></span>Survey/Questionnaire</h2>
      <p> 
        We conducted a survey to gather feedback from potential users about their mental health needs and
        expectations from a mental health application. The survey included questions about the user's mental health
        status, their daily routines, and their expectations from a mental health application. The survey was distributed
        online and the responses were collected and analyzed to identify common patterns and trends and in this way,
        we were able to identify the key features and functionalities that the users expect from a mental health
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The form was structured in six sections:
        <li>
        <strong>Statement of Informed Consent:</strong> The first section of the survey included a statement of informed
        consent,
        where the participants were informed about the purpose of the survey and the data collection process.
        <li>
        <strong>Current Mental Health Practices:</strong> This section included questions about the user's current mental
        health
        practices, such as meditation, exercise, and lieaks. The purpose of this section was to understand the
        user's current mental health practices and identify areas where the user needs support.
        <li>
        <strong>Challenges and Pain Points:</strong> The third section of the survey included questions about the user's
        challenges and pain points related to mental health. The purpose of this section was to identify the key
        challenges and pain points that the users face in their daily lives and how a mental health application can
        help address these challenges.
        <li>
        <strong>Preferences for Mental Health Support:</strong> This section included questions about the user's preferences
        for
        mental health support, such as the type of support they prefer and the features they expect from a mental
        health application. The purpose of this section was to identify the key features and functionalities that the
        users expect from a mental health application.
        <li>
        <strong>Motivation and Engagement:</strong> The fifth section of the survey included questions about the user's
        motivation and engagement with mental health applications. The purpose of this section was to
        understand what motivates the users to use a mental health application and how to keep them engaged
        with the application.
        <li>
        <strong>Demographics:</strong> The last section of the survey included questions about the user's demographics.
      </p>

      <h3>Survey Results</h3>
      The survey results showed that the users are looking for a mental health application that can help them track
      their mental health status, provide support and motivation, and help them stay engaged with their mental health
      practices. Based on the survey results, we identified the key features and functionalities that the users expect
      from a mental health application and used this information to inform the design and development of the Mental
      Health Companion App.

      <p>
        From these results, we discover that for most of the user interacting with other positive-energy
          people is a
        method to improve their mental health and in our application we will focus on this aspect, also their practice
        exercises and meditation and via our application on smartwatch they can track their
        progress and receive
        motivation to continue. Also, this aspect is sustained by the fact most of the user think the
        application would be
        convenient to use on a smartwatch. We also see the fact that the user read, listen to
          music and watch movies to
        relax and via our application we can offer them a list of articles and music to listen to. The
        gamification aspect
        is also important for the user, they like to be rewarded for their progress and this is a feature
        that we will
        implement in our application. This can be helpful for the user especially we can observe that most of the user
        experience burnout at work and this can be a way to motivate them to continue their daily exercises
        and
        meditation.

      <h2><span></span>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        During this project, we learned a lot about what it takes to make an app that people really like to use. Now, we know how much focus should be on the user needs as to make the app as user-friendly as possible. 
        If we put ourselves in the user's shoes doing persona research or creating storyboards, we can understand what they need and how they would like to interact with the app. We also learned the significance of starting the app design process with simple sketches before progressing to more
        detailed designs. This helped us to quickly iterate on our ideas and get feedback from our peers. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped us develop our skills in user experience design and interaction design and we are confident that the Mental Health Companion App will make a meaningful difference in people's lives.
