## Project: MeHe (Mental Health Companion App)

## Description:
  Design a smart companion assistant that keeps track of the user's mental health. From checking the level of daily exercises/movement, breaks, and meditation to interacting with other positive-energy people. The application can also track levels of burnout at work and offer intervention-like experiences to help motivate users. The application is distributed on various devices so that the user stays engaged. Gamification elements are also an added touch.
